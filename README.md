# XCF: Extended/Experimental Combat Framework

## XCF IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SINGLEPLAYER!! USE A 2-PLAYER LAN SERVER INSTEAD!! (this might fix problems with other mods too)
## All of the changes in this repo are in the lua, materials and models folder.  To save bandwidth, download only these folders and REPLACE those folders within an existing ACF install!

XCF is an extension to ACF which includes whatever I find interesting to add to it.

Please see the wiki for current features, planned features and usage documentation.
