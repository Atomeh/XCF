# XCF: Extended/Experimental Combat Framework

## Most/all of the changes in this repo are in the lua folder.  Download the lua.zip and apply it over an ACF installation!

XCF is an extension to ACF which includes whatever I find interesting to add to it.

Please see the wiki for current features, planned features and usage documentation.
