# XCF: Extended/Experimental Combat Framework

## All of the changes in this repo are in the lua, materials and models folder.  Download the lua.zip and unzip it over an ACF installation (delete + backup the original lua folder first)!
## XCF IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SINGLEPLAYER!! USE A 2-PLAYER LAN SERVER INSTEAD!! (this might fix problems with other mods too)

XCF is an extension to ACF which includes whatever I find interesting to add to it.

Please see the wiki for current features, planned features and usage documentation.

The Armoured Combat Framework is a [Garry's Mod][] addon which creates a balanced, realistic and fun to play combat damage system, simulating projectiles, armor and explosions, as well as engines and gearboxes.
