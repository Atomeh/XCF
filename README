XCF: Extended/Experimental Combat Framework

An extension of ACF to include whatever I find interesting to add to it.

The repo should currently be regarded as broken - I'm currently converting XCF from its original plugin format to a fully fledged ACF derivative.
This will take time and reduces installation flexibility.  It also makes it much easier for me to implement my ideas.
